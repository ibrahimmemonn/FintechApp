# Getting Started ðŸš€

I have successfully developed a cutting-edge fintech open-source application using React Native, incorporating a meticulously designed architecture. The key features and technologies integrated into the application include:

# Redux Toolkit:

Leveraging the power of state management through Redux Toolkit for efficient data handling and seamless updates.

# Redux-Persist:

Ensuring persistent state storage for enhanced user experience, allowing seamless data retrieval even after app closures.

# Bottom Navigation:

Implementing an intuitive and user-friendly navigation system, enhancing the overall accessibility and flow of the application.

# Splash Screen:

Incorporating a visually appealing splash screen to provide users with a smooth and engaging onboarding experience.

# Dark Mode Feature:

Offering users a personalized experience with a Dark Mode feature that seamlessly adapts to both user preferences and system preferences, enhancing usability in various settings.

# Async-storage:

Utilizing async-storage for efficient and asynchronous data storage, contributing to faster app performance and responsiveness.

# Structured Components:

Designing a robust component architecture that enhances the overall maintainability and scalability of the codebase.

# Clean and Minimal Design:

Prioritizing user experience with a clean and minimalistic design approach, ensuring that the application is not only visually appealing but also easy to navigate.

This comprehensive set of features reflects a commitment to best practices in app development, resulting in a sophisticated fintech application that excels in both functionality and design."

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
